    <h1>Structure Learning in Graph Attention Network based Network Anomaly Detection</h1>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      Network anomaly detection is a critical aspect of ensuring the security and stability of differnt kinds of networks.
      Graph Attention Networks (GATs) have shown promise in modeling complex relationships within graph-structured data, 
      making them well-suited for capturing intricate dependencies in network connections. 
      This research introduces an innovative approach to enhance network anomaly detection through the incorporation of structure learning within GATs.
      <br>
      The proposed method leverages the inherent ability of GATs to discern important nodes and edges in a network graph 
      while introducing a mechanism for adaptive structure learning based on causality. By dynamically adjusting attention weights during the training process, 
      our model autonomously identifies and prioritizes key structural elements, facilitating a more robust representation of network behavior. 
      This adaptability aims to improve the model's ability to discriminate between normal and anomalous network patterns while reducing the false positives.
      <br>
      We conduct comprehensive experiments on diverse graph structures to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for a water treatment plant sensor network. 
      The results demonstrate that our causality graph structure-enhanced GAT outperforms traditional GATs based on different node structures in detecting a wide range of network anomalies.
      This research contributes to the advancement of anomaly detection methodologies by combining the strengths of causal relations as the inputs to the GATs. 
      The proposed model exhibits promising results and opens avenues for further exploration in leveraging graph-based deep learning techniques based on cause and effect relations 
      while reducing the false detections without affecting detection rate of true positives.
